      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Finding Jobs in Nigeria</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">Nigeria is Africa's largest economy and its most populous nation, with a workforce of over 80 million people and a young, fast-growing talent pool. The Nigerian job market spans traditional sectors like oil and gas, banking, and FMCG alongside a rapidly expanding technology ecosystem centred in Lagos. JobMeter aggregates <strong>current job vacancies in Nigeria</strong> from verified employers daily, covering everything from <strong>graduate trainee programmes</strong> to <strong>director-level positions</strong> across all major industries.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Top Industries Hiring in Nigeria</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">Banking and financial services remain the largest formal employers, with institutions like Zenith Bank, GTBank, Access Bank, and First Bank running continuous recruitment for roles in retail banking, corporate finance, risk management, and digital banking. The <strong>oil and gas sector</strong> — including Shell, TotalEnergies, Seplat, and NNPC — offers some of the highest-paying positions in the country, particularly for engineers, HSE professionals, and project managers. Telecoms giants like MTN, Airtel, and Glo hire aggressively across commercial, technical, and customer service functions. The fast-growing <strong>Nigerian tech ecosystem</strong> — home to unicorns like Flutterwave, Paystack, and Interswitch — is creating thousands of <strong>technology jobs in Lagos</strong> annually.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Best Cities for Jobs in Nigeria</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">Lagos is the commercial capital and the single largest job market in Nigeria, accounting for the majority of private sector employment. Victoria Island, Ikoyi, Lekki, and the Mainland (Ikeja, Surulere, Yaba) are home to the highest concentration of employers. Abuja offers strong opportunities in government, NGOs, international organizations, and consulting — making it ideal for professionals in policy, development, and public administration. Port Harcourt is the hub for oil and gas employment and related engineering services. Kano, Ibadan, and Enugu are growing markets for FMCG, manufacturing, and retail.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Salary Expectations for Jobs in Nigeria</h3>

Multinationals and tier-one banks offer the highest packages — <strong>senior software developers in Lagos</strong> at fintech companies can earn ₦8–25 million per year, while investment bankers at leading institutions command similar figures. Mid-level marketing managers typically earn ₦3–7 million annually, while entry-level graduate roles range from ₦1.2–3 million depending on the company.

Companies in the UK, USA, Canada, and Europe actively hire Nigerian talent for remote roles, particularly in technology and creative fields. JobMeter's remote filter surfaces both Nigerian-company remote roles and international positions open to Nigerian applicants.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Graduate Jobs and Entry-Level Opportunities in Nigeria</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">Nigeria's graduate job market is highly competitive, with major banks, FMCG companies, and multinationals running structured <strong>graduate trainee programmes</strong> each year. Unilever, Nestle, Nigerian Breweries, Dangote Group, and the major banks are among the most sought-after graduate employers. Tech bootcamps and training programmes from organisations like Andela, Decagon, and HNG have created a pipeline of junior developers entering the market. Applying early, building practical skills, and tailoring your CV to each employer significantly improve your chances.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">How to Apply for Jobs in Nigeria</h3>
